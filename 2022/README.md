# 2022

Unwritten rules for this year

## Day 7
- `/aaa/bbb/aaa` path is **possible**. Managing depth correctly is important.
- `/eee/ccc/aaa` path is **_also_ possible**. This means you have to handle both depth and parent folder!

> Is a combination of 2 repeated folders with the same depth possible? Like both `/aaa/bbb/ccc/aaa` and `/aaa/ddd/ccc/aaa`?

I have no clue
