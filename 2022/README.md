# 2022

Unwritten rules for this year

## Day 7
- `/aaa/bbb/aaa` path is **possible**. Managing depth correctly is important.
- `/eee/ccc/aaa` path is **_also_ possible**. This means you have to handle both depth and parent folder!

> Is a combination of 2 repeated folders with the same depth possible? Like both `/aaa/bbb/ccc/aaa` and `/aaa/ddd/ccc/aaa`?

I have no clue

## Day 10
Tips for this day:

### Part 1
- Be careful to manipulate the `X` register in an `addx` as the **very last step** of `addx`.

### Part 2
- The sprite can (and will!) move back and forth between lines! The best way to proceed is to work on a **single giant line** and _then_ to split it in multiple 40-long lines (39 actually? idk)

## Day 11

### Part 2

Be good at basic math (modulo and lcm/gcd) or check [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/104uld8/2022_day_11_part_2_typescript_reducing_values/)
