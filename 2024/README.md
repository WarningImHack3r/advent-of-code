# 2024

Unwritten rules for this year

## Day 2

### Part 2

"Incorrect" numbers can also happen at the beginning or the end of the sequence,
not only in the middle like the example shows!

## Day 14

### Part 2

The maximum number of seconds is not 100 anymore!
The pattern can appear for the first time at any second (RIP your part 1 optimizations!)

Another tip: the Christmas tree has borders around it, find them: you found the tree!

## Day 16

### Part 2

A "best path" is a path with the lowest possible score.
Essentially, you have to find all the tiles that are part of all the paths that have the same score as part 1.
